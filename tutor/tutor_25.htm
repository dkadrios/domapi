The next section will get into this a bit more, but I'd like to take this time to get you aquainted with some basic concepts.<br /><br /> The library files come in one of two flavors. These are <b>compressed</b> and <b>uncompressed</b>. <u>If you are using the standard library, then all files are compressed only</u>. Compression drastically reduces the time it takes your users to download the code units at runtime. The compressed files have names that end with _c. For instance, the compressed version of <span class=inlinecode>domapi.js</span> is <span class=inlinecode>domapi_c.js</span>. One thing to keep in mind is that the version of <span class=inlinecode>domapi.js</span> that is loaded determines which version of all the other files are used. In other words, if you load the uncompressed <span class=inlinecode>domapi.js</span> unit, then all other units used on the page will be uncompressed as well; and vice-versa.<br /> At runtime you can determine whether or not you are using compressed files by examining the <span class=inlinecode>domapi.compressed</span> boolean property. </p><p> DomAPI is modular. Most all functionality is segregated into separate files. At runtime, DomAPI loads only the units it needs or that you tell it to. The idea is that the enduser's browser only needs to download exactly what it needs for your application and nothing more. This should help bring your pages up as quickly as possible. Also, if your user has their browser's cache turned on, then the Libraries files are only downloaded the first time they view your page.<br /> DomAPI keeps track of which files it has loaded, and will never try to load the same file on the same page twice. But we'll get more into this in the section on <span class=inlinecode>domapi.loadUnit()</span>. </p><div class="tutorNavBlock"><a href="tutor_19.htm"><img src="../docs/bin/left.gif" alt="Back" width="14" height="14" border="0"></a><a href="tutor_19.htm" title="Back">Installing the Library</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="tutor_index.htm"><img src="../docs/bin/up.gif" alt="Up to index" width="14" height="14" border="0"></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="tutor_20.htm" title="Next">Including 'domapi' in your pages</a><a href="tutor_20.htm"><img src="../docs/bin/right.gif" alt="Next" width="14" height="14" border="0"></a></div><hr />  </body></html>

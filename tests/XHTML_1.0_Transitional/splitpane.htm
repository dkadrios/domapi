"When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image...he was seen to
be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;
but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage. 'Who dares?...Who dares insult us with
this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him--that we may know whom we have to
hang at sunrise, from the battlements!"

"I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which the patients were
menages-humored. We contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad.
On the contrary, we not only indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most
permanent cures have been thus effected. There is no argument which so touches the
feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad absurdum. We have had men, for example,
who fancied themselves chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact- to
accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact- and
thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to
a chicken. In this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders."

"Extraordinary Murders. --This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. 
Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the 
fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame
 L'Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L'Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned 
 by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with 
 a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes. By this time 
 the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough 
 voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the 
 house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained 
 perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves, and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a 
 large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key 
 inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less 
 with horror than with astonishment.<br />
<br />
"The apartment was in the wildest disorder --the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. 
There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of 
the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and 
thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the 
roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, 
three smaller of metal d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The 
drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although 
many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the 
bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, 
and other papers of little consequence.<br />
<br />
"Of Madame L'Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the 
fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, 
head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a 
considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, 
no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face 
were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, 
as if the deceased had been throttled to death.<br />
<br />
"After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the party 
made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, 
with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well 
as the head, was fearfully mutilated --the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.<br />
<br />
"To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew."

    <P>This demo is a DomAPI-based implementation of a file browser.  It was originally written as both a proof 
    of concept and as an exercise for learning more about the DomAPI library.</P>
    <P>The main page of this example, WDesktop.htm, implements a simple desktop-like user interface and serves
    as a launch point for the rest of the demo.  Note that although you may directly open any html page in this demo, 
    only WDesktop.htm was meant to be browsed directly.</P>
    <P>At the core of this example is the file wd_explore.htm, in which the file browser is implemented.  The demo uses 
    the Tree, Listgrid, Toolbar, Menubar, Speedbutton, and the Splitpane or Splitter DomAPI components. The file manager 
    also  makes use of the reflow, xmlcore, and JSON extensions.  The useSplitPane variable, defined inWDesktop.htm, can 
    be changed by the user to specify whether a splitpane or a splitter component is to be used on the page (2 different 
    splitter implementations).</P>
    <P>This demo was originally tied to a back-end data engine that produced JSON packets for the client; however, for the 
    purposes of this demo, the original mechanism has been replaced by an XML data source (wd_serverdata.xml) and JSON-producing 
    script (implemented in wd_getJsonData.js).  The script uses XSLT transformations to produce on-demand JSON data for the tree and 
    listgrid (data is produced as new tree nodes are selected/expanded).</P>
    <P>Enjoy!
